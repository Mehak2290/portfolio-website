# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Portfolio Website - Instructions

This portfolio website showcases coursework completed during the program. It is Dockerized for easy deployment.


## Running the Dockerized React App

To run the Dockerized React app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

2. **Navigate to the Root Directory**: 
   Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.

3. **Build the Docker Image**: 
   Run the following command to build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t kaur_mehakdeep_coding_assignment14 .
   ```

4. **Run the Docker Container**: 
   Once the image is built successfully, run the Docker container with the following command:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5575:80 kaur_mehakdeep_coding_assignment14
   ```

5. **Access the Portfolio Website**: 
   Open your web browser and navigate to [localhost:5575](http://localhost:5575) to view the portfolio website.

## Directory Structure

Ensure that your directory structure aligns with the following:

- Root Directory
  - `README.md`
  - `Dockerfile`
  - `src/`
  - `public/`
  - `kaur_mehakdeep_final_site/` (working directory for site files)
